# GNU Radio AM Transmitter

## Overview

This project implements an **Amplitude Modulation (AM) Transmitter** using GNU Radio. The transmitter accepts a real-time audio signal from the microphone, generates a carrier signal, performs amplitude modulation using signal multiplication, and visualizes the transmitted waveform in both the time and frequency domains.

The project demonstrates the fundamentals of **analog communication**, **Software Defined Radio (SDR)**, and **Digital Signal Processing (DSP)**.
